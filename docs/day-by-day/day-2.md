# Day 2: Rust Webhook Skeleton ✅ COMPLETE

**Date:** July 22, 2025  
**Time Spent:** ~3 hours  
**Status:** Successful - Basic webhook server working and JSON structures defined

## What I Built Today

### Core Rust Infrastructure
✅ **Rust Project:** `cargo init rust-ingestor` - initialized with proper dependencies  
✅ **Webhook Server:** Basic axum HTTP server listening on 127.0.0.1:8080  
✅ **JSON Data Structures:** Complete struct definitions for Pub/Sub and Gmail notifications  
✅ **Local Testing:** curl tests passing with HTTP 200 responses  

### Data Structure Design
✅ **PubSubMessage:** Top-level struct for complete webhook payload  
✅ **PubSubData:** Nested struct containing base64 data and metadata  
✅ **GmailNotification:** Target struct for decoded Gmail notification content  
✅ **Serde Integration:** Proper serialization/deserialization attributes  

### Dependencies Configuration
```toml
[dependencies]
axum = "0.7"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
serde = { version = "1.0", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1.0"
base64 = "0.22"
tower = "0.4"
tower-http = { version = "0.5", features = ["cors"] }
```

## Issues Encountered
See [Day 2 Issues](../troubleshooting.md#day-2-issues) in troubleshooting guide.  

## Architecture Decisions

### Why 127.0.0.1 Instead of 0.0.0.0?
- **Development reliability:** Avoids localhost DNS resolution issues
- **Security:** Only allows connections from same machine
- **Note for Day 3:** Will need to switch back to 0.0.0.0 for ngrok integration

### Why Separate Structs for Each JSON Layer?
- **Type safety:** Each layer has specific, validated structure
- **Clarity:** Easy to understand the data flow and transformations
- **Debugging:** Can inspect data at each stage of processing
- **Maintainability:** Changes to one layer don't affect others

## Current State

### Working Data Flow
```
Incoming JSON → PubSubMessage struct → PubSubData.data (base64 string)
↓
[Tomorrow: base64 decode → GmailNotification struct]
```

### Code Structure
```
rust-ingestor/
├── Cargo.toml          # Dependencies and project config
├── src/
│   └── main.rs         # Complete webhook server with data structures
└── target/             # Compiled binaries (generated)
```

### Local Testing Verified
```bash
# Server starts successfully
cargo run
# → "Server is running on http://127.0.0.1:8080"

# Basic webhook endpoint responds
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8080/gmail-event
# → Returns HTTP 200, prints "Webhook received!"
```

## Tomorrow's Plan (Day 3)

### Development Tasks
- Implement base64 decoding logic in `handle_webhook()` function
- Add JSON parsing of decoded Gmail notification data
- Restart ngrok and update Pub/Sub subscription endpoint
- Test end-to-end pipeline with real Pub/Sub messages
- Deploy to Cloud Run for permanent webhook URL

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Webhook successfully decodes base64 data field
- [ ] Parsed Gmail notifications show emailAddress and historyId
- [ ] End-to-end flow: Gmail → Pub/Sub → ngrok → Rust webhook
- [ ] All Pub/Sub retry loops stop (webhook returning 200 OK)
- [ ] Ready for Gmail API integration to fetch actual email content

### Technical Goals
- Complete the three-layer data processing pipeline
- Integrate with existing Day 1 Pub/Sub infrastructure
- Prepare foundation for Gmail API calls using historyId

### Commands for Tomorrow
```bash
# Start the improved webhook server
cd rust-ingestor
cargo run

# Restart ngrok with new tunnel
ngrok http 8080

# Update Pub/Sub subscription with new ngrok URL
gcloud pubsub subscriptions update gmail-webhook-sub \
  --push-endpoint=https://NEW_NGROK_URL.ngrok-free.app/gmail-event

# Test with real Pub/Sub message
gcloud pubsub topics publish gmail-events --message="test"
```
